# enterprise cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/enterprise-chef-common.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/enterprise-chef-common)

This cookbook provides common functionality needed for Chef server, Push jobs, Reporting, and other enterprise-grade Omnibus projects.

Your omnibus project attributes should define the following attributes:

```
node['enterprise']['name']
```

This defaults to `private_chef` for back compat. If you are building top-level (non add-on) project, set it to your project name.

In addition, you need to have:

- `node[project_name]['install_path']` the install location for your omnibus project (e.g. `/opt/chef-server`).

Optional attributes are:

- `node[project_name]['sysvinit_id']` an identifier used in `/etc/inittab` (default is `'SV'`). Needs to be a unique (for the file) sequence of 1-4 characters.
- `node[project_name]['topology']` one of `standalone`, `tier`, or `ha`.
- `node[project_name]['role']` either `backend` or `frontend`.
- `node[project_name]['servers'][node_name]['bootstrap']` is used to determine if the node is installation bootstrap server. Value is treated as boolean.
- `node[project_name]['keepalived']['dir']` directory for keepalived.
